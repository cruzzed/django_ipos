# Cash Count Checker for iPos 5

This project is solely for educational purposes only.

The project is a simple Python/Tkinter app for cash counting
validated against an [IPOS system database version 5](https://inspirasi.biz/produk/detail/KBKAT-20170403132947) .

## Main Functions include:
-  Login Form
-  Main Cash Counter Dialog
-  Text File Logging

## Usages
Run the app.py

## Project Key Takeaway
This is a demonstration of utilizing a Django's very popular and easy to use ORM
to apply for application outside of the web. The database was already existed on the IPOS system 
which the ORM can make into models using `python manage.py inspectdb > models.py` command.
The major reason for this project is of the limitation of the IPOS system to be extended as it is a 
proprietary software to begin with. This project provides an extension feature to the clientele.
